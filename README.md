# fortran-neural-network
A neural network written in Fortran, the best programming language in the universe!

Nothing fancy, just written for the purpose of playing around.

Input is fixed in the file, no file I/O yet.

It's also quite stupid and unable to learn anything, it can just do feedforward.
